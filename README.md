# IntentOS

IntentOS is a minimal Android interface concept that lets users declare intention before using their phone.

Instead of reacting to notifications, the device adapts to the user's purpose.

Built for the Nothing Essential App Challenge.

## Concept
User declares intent → phone adapts behavior.

## Intents
Work — focus mode  
Message — messaging priority  
Relax — calm mode  
Urgent — full access  

## Philosophy
Technology should respect attention, not compete for it.
