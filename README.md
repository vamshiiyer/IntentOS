# IntentOS

IntentOS is an experimental Android interface concept that allows users to declare their intention before using their phone, shifting device interaction from reactive to intentional.

Built for the Nothing Essential App Challenge.

---

## Overview

Modern smartphones compete for attention.  
IntentOS explores an alternative interaction model:

User declares intent → device behavior adapts.

Instead of reacting to notifications, the interface aligns with the user's purpose.

---

## Why I Built This

I wanted to explore how minimal interface design + intentional interaction could redefine smartphone behavior.

The goal was not just to build an app, but to prototype a new interaction philosophy aligned with Nothing’s design principles:
minimal
functional
purpose-driven

## Development Approach

This project was developed using an AI-assisted workflow to accelerate ideation, UI structuring, and logic scaffolding.

AI was used as a development partner for:
- rapid prototyping
- architectural suggestions
- UI refinement
- logic structuring

All final decisions, interaction design, and concept direction were designed and implemented by me.

This reflects a modern development approach:
leveraging AI tools to build faster, think deeper, and prototype smarter.

## Core Features

• Intent-based interaction model  
• Minimal interface design  
• Instant visual feedback  
• Distraction-aware logic system  
• State-driven UI behavior  

---

## Intents

WORK  
Focus-oriented interface behavior

MESSAGE  
Communication-priority mode

RELAX  
Low-stimulation environment

URGENT  
Full-access state

---

## Design Philosophy

Technology should respect attention, not compete for it.

IntentOS is a prototype exploring how devices can adapt to human intention instead of shaping it.
